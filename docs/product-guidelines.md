# Product Guidelines

## Visual Identity
- **Utility-First Aesthetic:** The primary goal is data density and ease of reading. Minimize visual flair and prioritize the data being presented. Use clear borders and minimal spacing to maximize visible content.

## Brand Messaging & Tone
- **Minimalist Communication:** Feedback should be extremely concise. Use status indicators, icons, or single-word updates where possible. Avoid conversational or overly friendly language; focus on efficiency.

## Design Principles
- **Density-First Layout:** Maximize the amount of relevant data shown on a single screen without overcrowding. Prioritize content over whitespace.
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Employ clear headings, distinct sections, and subtle color coding to help users quickly differentiate between primary data (e.g., item name/ID) and secondary details (e.g., nested JSON fields).
- **Keyboard-Centric Navigation:** Every action must be accessible via keyboard shortcuts. Ensure high-frequency tasks (searching, scrolling, switching focus) are mapped to intuitive and easily reachable keys.
